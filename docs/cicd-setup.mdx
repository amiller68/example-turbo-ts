NOTE: part of this setup assumes you've set up the [prerequisites](./deploying-services.mdx#prerequisites) for deploying services.

# CI/CD Setup for Services

Our CI/CD pipeline automatically:

- builds and deploys services using GitHub Actions on pushes to `main` and `dev` branches.
- triggers a test build + terraform plan for PRs into `main` and `dev` branches.

Relevant workflow files:

- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` - Apply terraform + deploy services to ECS
- `.github/workflows/docker-build.yml` - Builds docker images for services for PRs
- `.github/workflows/terraform-plan.yml` - Triggers a terraform plan for PRs

## Prerequisites

### 1. GitHub Actions Secrets
You'll need to add the following secrets to your GitHub repository:

- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
- `AWS_REGION` (Not required if you want to use `us-east-1`, our scripts will default to this)

This should be the same as the AWS credentials you setup in the first step.

### 2. Configuring the workflow to target your services

In order for our CI/CD pipeline to build and deploy your services, you'll need to add your service to the list of dockerized services in the workflow.

Just follow the `TODO (service-cicd)` markers in the file.

```yaml
# In .github/actions/detect-service-changes/action.yml
DOCKERIZED_SERVICES=("example" "your-service-name") # Add your service here
```
