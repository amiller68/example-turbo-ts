# Deploying Services

This guide covers the steps needed to deploy a service to a new AWS. Follow these steps in order:

1. Set up AWS credentials
2. Configure Route 53 domain
3. Create Terraform state storage
4. Set up ECR repository
5. Deploy service infrastructure

Each step is detailed below.

## 1. AWS Credentials

You need AWS admin credentials to deploy services:

```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your-access-key"
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your-secret-key"
export AWS_REGION="us-east-1"  # or your preferred region
```

Get these from your AWS IAM Console under Security Credentials.

## 2. Route 53 Setup

1. Create a hosted zone for your domain in Route 53
2. Create a subdomain for AWS services:
   ```bash
   aws route53 create-hosted-zone --name aws.yourdomain.com --caller-reference $(date +%s)
   ```
3. Add NS records in your main domain pointing to the subdomain's nameservers
4. Update `iac/modules/aws/main.tf` with your domain name

## 3. Terraform State Storage

Create required AWS resources for Terraform state:

```bash
# Create and configure S3 bucket
aws s3 mb s3://example-turbo-ts-tf-state --region us-east-1
aws s3api put-bucket-versioning \
  --bucket example-turbo-ts-tf-state \
  --versioning-configuration Status=Enabled

# Create DynamoDB table for state locking
aws dynamodb create-table \
  --table-name example-turbo-ts-tf-state-lock \
  --attribute-definitions AttributeName=LockID,AttributeType=S \
  --key-schema AttributeName=LockID,KeyType=HASH \
  --provisioned-throughput ReadCapacityUnits=1,WriteCapacityUnits=1 \
  --region us-east-1
```

## Deploying ECR Repository

Each service requires a new ECR repository in order to store its images.

If you haven't already, you'll need to create a new ECR repository for your service.

In order to do this, you'll need to add your service to the `iac/envs/aws-ecr/main.tf` file.

```terraform
locals {
  # Add your service to the list by its canonical name
  services = ["example", "your-service-name"]
}
```

Then from the `./iac` directory, run the following commands:

```bash
# Initialize ECR terraform if needed
./bin/tf ecr init

# see the plan for what will be created
./bin/tf ecr plan

# apply the changes
./bin/tf ecr apply -auto-approve
```

A new ECR repository will be created in your AWS account + region.

Once this is done, CI/CD will be able to push images to the repository.
If you'd like to push images manually during development, you can do so with the `docker.sh` script. See [docker-build-push.mdx](./docker-build-push.mdx) for more details.

## Deploying ECS Infrastructure

### Prerequisites

Before deploying your service, ensure you have:

1. AWS credentials with admin privileges configured in your environment:
   ```bash
   export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your-access-key"
   export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your-secret-key"
   export AWS_REGION="us-east-1"  # or your target region
   ```

2. The service's ECR repository created (see ECR Repository section below)

These AWS credentials will be used for:
- Deploying infrastructure with Terraform
- Pushing Docker images to ECR
- Running ECS tasks and services
- Managing other AWS resources (S3, etc.)

No additional environment variables or secret management setup is required - the service will use these AWS credentials for all necessary authentication and access.

## Step 2: Set Up Service Infrastructure

The current example service is setup to be a good starting point for new services.

1. Copy the example service module:

```bash
cp -r iac/modules/aws/services/example iac/modules/aws/services/your-service-name
```

2. Register your service in `iac/modules/aws/services/main.tf`:

```terraform
module "your_service" {
  source           = "./your-service-name"
  # TODO (service-deploy): add your service's specific variables here
}

locals {
  service_modules = {
    "example" = module.example.service,
    # TODO (service-deploy): add your service's module here
    "your-service-name" = module.your_service.service
  }
}
```

## Step 3: Service URLs

Your service will be accessible at:
`https://{environment}.aws.krondor.org/your-service-name`

The URL will be available as an output from the AWS module and can be referenced by other services through the AWS Parameter Store.

## Step 4: Deploy the Service

Use `terraform` to deploy your service from the `iac` directory:

```bash
# For staging environment
cd iac/envs/production
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

At this point, your service should be deployed to AWS and accessible at
`https://{staging|production}.aws.getquotient.com/your-service-name`.

## CI/CD

Our CI/CD pipeline automatically builds and deploys services using GitHub Actions. The workflow is defined in `.github/workflows/service-deploy.yml`.

In order to enable CI/CD for your service, you'll need to:

1. Add your service to the list of dockerized services our action for detecting changes to dockerized services:

```yaml
# In .github/actions/detect-service-changes/action.yml
DOCKERIZED_SERVICES=("image-renderer" "your-service-name") # Add your service here
```

You can follow the `TODO (service-cicd)` markers in the file to easily add your service.

See [cicd-setup.mdx](./cicd-setup.mdx) for more details on how our CI/CD pipeline works.

## Service Configuration Options

When implementing your service module, you have several configuration options available at different levels. Let's explore these using the `image-renderer` service as an example.

### Global Defaults

In `iac/modules/aws/services/_defaults/`, define default configurations that are shared across all services:

```terraform
# in iac/modules/aws/services/_defaults/main.tf
# container defaults for all services
output "container" {
  description = "Default container configuration"
  value = {
    # all containers run on port 3000
    port   = 3000
    # have a default of 256 cpu and 512 memory
    cpu    = 256
    memory = 512
    # and reflect our very strict tag + naming conventions
    repository   = var.name
    tag          = var.environment == "production" ? "latest" : "staging-latest"
    # we have a standard health check endpoint for all services
    health_check = "/${var.name}/_status/readyz"
    # and a standard set of environment variables.
    environment = [
      {
        name  = "ENV"
        value = var.environment
      },
      {
        name  = "BASE_PATH"
        value = "/${var.name}"
      }
    ]
  }
}

# service defaults for all services
output "service" {
  description = "Default service configuration"
  value = {
    # a standard description for all services
    description           = "${var.name} service"
    # a standard desired count for all services
    desired_count         = 1
    # a standard auto scaling configuration for all services
    auto_scaling          = true
    min_capacity          = 1
    max_capacity          = 3
    scaling_cpu_threshold = 70
    # a standard listener rule for all services
    #  it is very important that this aligns with the BASE_PATH in the container
    #  environment variables!
    lb_listener_rule = {
      path_pattern = ["/${var.name}/*"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Service Definition Defaults

In your service module's `main.tf`, define default configurations that are specific to your service:

```terraform
locals {
  service = {
    # Container configuration. This must at least be an empty object if
    #  you want to use all of the defaults from the global defaults.
    # However, in the case of the image renderer:
    container = {
      cpu    = 512 # we upped this from 256 to 512 for the image renderer
      memory = 1024 # we upped this from 512 to 1024 for the image renderer
      environment = [
        # We need to explicitly set the AWS region for the image renderer
        #  in order to use the S3 bucket in the same region as the service
        {
          name  = "AWS_REGION"
          value = var.aws_region
        }
        # And we passed in the bucket name for assets from the shared resources
        {
          name  = "AWS_S3_BUCKET"
          value = var.shared_resources.assets.bucket
        }
      ]
      # We cache fonts in an EFS volume for the image renderer. This defines where we mount it.
      mount_points = [
        {
          sourceVolume  = "fonts-cache"
          containerPath = "/app/fonts/dynamic"
          readOnly      = false
        }
      ]
    }

    # And this defines the EFS volume itself.
    volumes = [
      {
        name = "fonts-cache"
        efs = {
          creation_token   = "fonts-cache"
          encrypted        = true
          performance_mode = "generalPurpose"
          throughput_mode  = "bursting"
          owner_uid        = "1001"
          owner_gid        = "1001"
          permissions      = "777"
          root_directory   = "/"
        }
      }
    ]

    # Basic services don't need any special permissions. However, if you need
    #  to access other AWS resources, you can define a policy here. The Image
    #  Renderer service needs access to the assets bucket to write out rendered
    #  images to the assets bucket.
    # If you don't need any special permissions, you can omit this.
    policy = {
      Version = "2012-10-17"
      Statement = [
        {
          Effect = "Allow"
          Action = [
            "s3:GetObject",
            "s3:PutObject"
          ]
          Resource = [
            var.shared_resources.assets.bucket_arn,
            "${var.shared_resources.assets.bucket_arn}/*"
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Environment-Specific Overrides

Finally, in your environment configuration, you can override the defaults for your service. This is most useful for passing in environment variables for your service.

```terraform
# in iac/envs/{environment}/main.tf
service_configurations = {
  "your-service-name" = {
    # Override container settings
    container = {
      cpu    = 1024  # override the service level default cpu
      memory = 2048  # override the service level default memory
      # append any additional environment variables here
      environment = [
        {
          name  = "YOUR_SERVICE_NAME_AUTH_KEY"
          value = var.your_service_name_auth_key
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Configuration Hierarchy

Configurations are applied in the following order (later ones override earlier ones):

1. **Global Defaults** (`_defaults/`)
2. **Service Defaults** (your service's `main.tf`)
3. **Environment Overrides** (`envs/{environment}/main.tf`)

## Next Steps

Once your service is deployed, you can interact with it using the `./bin/ecs` script.

See [ecs-commands.mdx](./ecs-commands.mdx) for more details.
