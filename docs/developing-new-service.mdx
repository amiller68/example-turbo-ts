# Developing a New Service

The `apps/example` directory serves as an opinionated template for creating new Express.js services in our monorepo. It provides a standardized foundation with built-in patterns for common service requirements.

## Step 1: Copy the Template

1. Copy the entire `apps/example` directory to create your new service:

```bash
cp -r apps/example apps/your-service-name
```

2. **Important**: The directory name must match the service name in `package.json`. For example, if your service is called `image-renderer`, it should be under `apps/image-renderer` with matching `name` field in `package.json`.

See [Naming Conventions](./naming-conventions.mdx) for more details.

## Step 2: Implement Service Setup Tasks

NOTE: You may just follow the `TODO (service-setup)` markers throughout the template in order to carry out the following changes.

You'll need to implement a couple of changes to make sure the service works in
development and is ready to be deployed to AWS.

- Update `package.json` to:
  - Replace `example` with your service name in the `name` field.
- Update `Dockerfile` to:
  - Replace `example` with your service name in the `SERVICE_NAME` argument at
    the top of the `Dockerfile`.
- Update `README.md` to:
  - Keep this up to date with your service's details so that others can understand it:
    - what it does
    - how its configured
    - what apis it exposes

There are a few other `TODO (service-setup)` comments in the template that you
may also want to implement. If not mentioned above, they are optional and context specific. You may want to take a look at:

- `src/index.ts`: there's specific parts in the startup logic where you may
  need to add one-time setup logic.
- `src/server/health/readyz.ts`: this endpoint is used by the AWS ALB to determine if the service is ready to receive traffic. For now it's a simple health check that always returns a 200. You SHOULD update this to check the actual health of your service if you add external services as dependencies (such as a database or S3 bucket).

## Step 3: Local Development

At this point you should be able to run your service locally within the monorepo.

1. Install dependencies (from the root of the repo):

```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Run basic tests:

```bash
npm test
```

## Next Steps

Once you've set up your service:

- [Build and push Docker images](./docker-build-push.mdx)
- [Deploy your service](./deploying-services.mdx)
- Review [naming conventions](./naming-conventions.mdx)
