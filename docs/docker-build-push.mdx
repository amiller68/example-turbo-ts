# Docker Build and Push

We use a standardized Docker build process for all services, managed through our `bin/docker` script.

If you've followed the [developing-new-service.mdx](./developing-new-service.mdx) guide, you should have a service that can be built and pushed to ECR.

Once both our ECR + service infrastructure is setup, you won't need to manually push images. Our CI/CD pipeline will handle this for you. This guide is still useful for building images locally during development.

## Building Images

Again, you won't need to manually build images. Our CI/CD pipeline will handle this for you. This guide is still useful for building images locally during development.

```bash
# Development build (uses host platform)
./bin/docker build your-service-name

# Staging / Production build (required for AWS Fargate)
./bin/docker build your-service-name -p linux/amd64
```

## Pushing Images

NOTE: Each service requires a new ECR repository in order to store its images.
If you haven't already, you'll need to create a new ECR repository for your service. See [deploying-services.mdx](./deploying-services.mdx) for more details.

While CI/CD typically handles image pushing, you can manually push images during development:

```bash
# Push with AWS credentials in environment
./bin/docker push your-service-name

# Push to staging, with `staging-latest`, no branch protection,
#  and allowing pushes against dirty branches
./bin/docker push your-service-name -D -L -S
```
You will need proper permssions set in your environment prior to pushing images.

### Image Tagging Process

When pushing images, the script:

1. Tags images based on Git branch:
   - `main` → `latest`
   - `dev` → `staging-latest`
   - Other branches → `staging-{type}-{hash}` (e.g., `staging-feat-abc123`)
2. Pushes to your service's ECR repository
3. Manages environment-specific tags

### Authentication

For pushing images, you'll need AWS credentials provided as environment variables:

- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
- `AWS_REGION`

## Next Steps

Once your images are built and pushed:

- [Deploy your service](./deploying-services.mdx)
- Review [naming conventions](./naming-conventions.mdx)
