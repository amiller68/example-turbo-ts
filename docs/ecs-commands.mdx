# ECS Commands

The `./bin/ecs` script provides two commands for working with ECS containers:

## SSH into Containers

To SSH into a running container:

```bash
# SSH into a container in staging
./bin/ecs ssh staging your-service-name

# SSH into a specific task in production
./bin/ecs ssh production your-service-name 123456789
```

If no task ID is provided, the script will automatically select a random running task.

## Force New Deployments

To force a new deployment of a service:

```bash
# Force new deployment in staging
./bin/ecs deploy staging your-service-name

# Force new deployment in production
./bin/ecs deploy production your-service-name
```

This is useful when you need to restart a service or ensure it picks up new configuration changes.
