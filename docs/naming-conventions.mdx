# Service Naming Conventions

Consistent naming is critical for our service infrastructure to work correctly. This guide outlines the required naming conventions across all service components.

## Required Name Consistency

Your service name must be identical (using kebab-case) across all these locations:

1. **Application Code**

   - Directory name: `apps/your-service-name/`
   - Package name in `package.json`: `"name": "your-service-name"`

2. **Docker/ECR**

   - ECR repository name in `iac/envs/aws-ecr/main.tf`

3. **Infrastructure**
   - Service module directory: `iac/modules/aws/services/your-service-name/`
   - Service module name in `iac/modules/aws/services/main.tf::locals.service_modules`: `"your-service-name": module.your-service-name`
   - Service name in `iac/envs/{env}/main.tf::service_configurations`: `"your-service-name": { ... }`

If you do so, you'll be able to take full advantage of our automated tooling for building, deploying, and managing services destined for AWS.

## Examples

Here's how a service named `data-processor` should be referenced:

```
# Directory Structure
apps/data-processor/
iac/modules/aws/services/data-processor/

# package.json
{
  "name": "data-processor"
}

# iac/envs/aws-ecr/main.tf
locals {
  services = ["data-processor"]
}

# iac/modules/aws/services/main.tf
module "data_processor" {  # Note: this one doesn't matter
  source = "./data-processor"  # And neither does this
}

locals {
  service_modules = {
    # NOTE: but this one does!
    "data-processor" = module.data_processor.service
  }
}

# Environment Configuration
service_configurations = {
  "data-processor" = {
    # configuration here
    # ...
  }
}
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Inconsistent Casing**

   - ❌ `DataProcessor`
   - ❌ `data_processor`
   - ✅ `data-processor`

2. **Different Names in Different Places**

   - ❌ `data-processor` in ECR but `processor` in Terraform
   - ✅ `data-processor` consistently everywhere

3. **Using Different Separators**
   - ❌ Using both hyphens and underscores
   - ✅ Always use hyphens except in Terraform variable names
